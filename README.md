# PowerSDI
Calculates the Standardised Precipitation (SPI) and Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration (SPEI) indices using NASA POWER data.

# Basic Description
The PowerSDI is an R package capable of calculating the SPI and SPEI using NASA POWER data.
The package is based on five R-functions designed to calculate these two standardised drought indices (SDI) in scientific and operational/routine modes.
The functions `ScientSDI()`, `Accuracy()`, `Reference()` and, `PlotData()` may be used to assess, among other features, the ability of the SPI and SPEI frequency distributions to meet the normality assumption and how well NASA POWER estimates represent “real-world” data.
The `OperatSDI()` function calculates both SPI and SPEI in an operational mode.

The PowerSDI adopts a basic time scale that splits each month into four subperiods: days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month.
For instance, if TS=4, the time scale corresponds to a moving window with a 1-month length that is calculated four times each month.
If TS=48, the time scale corresponds to a moving window with a 12-month length that is calculated four times each month.
This time scale is referred to as "quart.month".

The package depends on R (>= 3.10) and R packages {[nasapower](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/)} and {[lmom](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lmom)}.
